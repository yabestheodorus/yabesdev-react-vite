I’m Yabes Theodorus — a blockchain and smart contract developer 
who builds secure, gas-efficient, and audit-ready Web3 systems. 
This is my introduction. For deeper insights, explore the pages below.

Smart Contracts  

    Write production-grade Solidity with strict adherence to the CEI (Checks-Effects-Interactions) pattern  
    Optimize gas through tight struct packing, custom error design, and efficient storage layouts  
    Include complete NatSpec documentation for every contract, function, and error  
    Deliver with comprehensive test suites: unit, fuzz, and stateful invariant tests using Foundry

dApps  

    Develop full-stack decentralized applications using React, Wagmi, and WalletConnect  
    Prioritize smooth user onboarding, responsive UIs (with Tailwind CSS), and real-time blockchain interaction  
    Integrate Chainlink oracles, on-chain analytics, and gas estimation for enhanced UX  
    Ship with interaction scripts and deployment workflows for seamless testing and iteration

Engineering Approach  

    Start every contract with threat modeling and gas budgeting  
    Enforce consistent Solidity structure: errors → events → constructor → external → internal  
    Test early and often: fuzzing and invariants catch bugs before mainnet  
    Favor clarity and auditability over cleverness—code should be easy to read, review, and extend

Tech Stack  

    Smart Contracts: Solidity, Foundry, OpenZeppelin, Chainlink  
    Testing: Forge (unit, fuzz, invariant), Cast, Chisel  
    Frontend: React, TypeScript, Wagmi, Viem, Tailwind CSS  
    Tooling: Hardhat (legacy), Ethers.js, WalletConnect, Framer Motion

About
I’m a detail-oriented Web3 engineer with a passion for writing correct, comprehensible, 
and optimized code. When I’m not auditing storage layouts or tweaking fuzz test parameters, 
I’m contributing to open-source tools or sharing insights on secure Solidity patterns.

Contact
Have a project that demands gas efficiency, reentrancy safety, and clean architecture? 
Let’s connect. I’m open to smart contract development, audits, and full-stack Web3 collaborations.
